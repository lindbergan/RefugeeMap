# **Half-time evaluation**
Our team is currently working on the second sprint and at the moment most of the members have their head deep into code. The group’s general attitude toward working with Scrum is positive and our proficiency is gradually improving.

### **First sprint**
We began our first sprint with a two-hour meeting, the first half of which was spent discussing the project’s technical approach. Afterwards, we set our initial working velocity to 140 function points per week - as our group contains seven members, each with approximately twenty hours to spend on the project per week, one point corresponds to a single person working for approximately one hour.

When it was time to do time estimations for our user stories and tasks, we were generous when assigning function points, as we believed that much time would be spent on other tasks such as finalizing the project’s configuration, setting up the Android emulator and organizing the Git workflow. This was also a lesson we learned from the Lego-based Scrum exercise - how easy it was to underestimate the amount of time needed for a given task.

In the end we finished the sprint according to plan and combined our work into the first release. At this point, the deliverable was certainly basic - while an initial version of the database had been implemented, it had not been integrated into the application itself, and the application’s user interface was barely functional - but it was nonetheless a working prototype with the core features in place. This was also intentional, as getting a rough-cut prototype up and running would add more customer value than fully developing and polishing only a single aspect of the app. However, given the fact that the database code had largely been implemented but not integrated into the app meant some instances of the development hadn't been strictly vertical. 

### **Daily stand-up meetings**
The daily stand-up meetings have, so far, been working well. As the group’s members generally work from different locations, the meetings have been used to keep everyone aware of the others’ activities. Our goal was, and still is, to avoid details and keep the meeting moving rapidly, instead discussing more advanced problems during separate, individual meetings.

### **Struggles**
At times, defining a particular user story left us puzzled. What is a user story? Does it have to bring value to the customer? Does a bug count as a user story? We also needed to concentrate on splitting every user story into thin vertical slices - currently, the scope can vary greatly between user stories and some are difficult to define. We need to establish a clearer definition of "done" both for individual user stories and for the project as a whole.

We also do not have a defined “product owner”. We have had meetings with our mentors from Interaction Design and have gotten a lot of great feedback from them. We have also arranged to meet them every week, so they are at least partially serving as our “product owners” at the moment.

Another issue faced is that we failed to consider meetings and lectures as part of our working week. While we only code approximately 20 hours per week, the added hours from meetings and lectures mean that we are overworking.

In short, things are going smoothly and the application is coming along nicely. We need to work on our definition of user stories and possibly come up with a concrete definition of our “product owner”. Aside from that, we will keep working to deliver a functional and intuitive application while following and continuing to learn about the Scrum process.
